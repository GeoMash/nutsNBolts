If so, it will still be relatively cheap. The new \"high speed\" train California wants to build is supposed to cost about $70 billion, and that estimate is no doubt absurdly low, too.\r\n\"Some of the technologies have not yet been fully worked out.\" Of course they haven\'t. You could say the same for any ambitious technology project. That\'s not a reason not to start trying to work them out.\r\n\"There will be challenges acquiring the necessary land and permits.\" Of course there will be challenges--these and other ones. Just as there were challenges acquiring the necessary land for our Interstate and other road systems, train systems, airports, telecommunications and electricity infrastructure, and other projects. If a necessary prerequisite for any project is that there not be any \"challenges,\" nothing would ever get built.\r\n\"It might not be completely safe--California is an earthquake zone.\" Of course it won\'t be completely safe. No mode of transportation is completely safe. Tens of thousands of people die in car accidents every year. Planes crash. Boats sink. Buses tumble off mountain roads. People will almost certainly die on the Hyperloop. But that means it will be just like every other transportation system.\r\n\"There will be political opposition.\" Of course there will be political opposition. There is political opposition to everything. But sometimes, miraculously, stuff actually gets done.\r\n\"It will probably cost a lot more than $20 to ride.\" Yes, it probably will cost more than $20. But driving, flying, or taking the train between L.A. and San Francisco will also cost you a lot more than $20. And those things take a heck of a lot longer. And unlike most of those methods of transportation, the Hyperloop will have very low operational costs (most of the cost is in the infrastructure). And that means that \"peak\" pricing could be much higher, while off-peak is a steal.\r\n\"It will be a terrorist target, and it will be easier to blow up than planes.\" Almost certainly true! Terrorists will no doubt try to smuggle bombs aboard Hyperloop capsules and blow them up while they\'re whooshing along at 760mph. Other terrorists will try to blow up Hyperloop pipes in the hope that a few capsules will go flying out at 760mph. And, someday, some terrorist will probably successfully disable the Hyperloop. But the same can be said for terrorists and planes, trains, buses, boats, and cars. And people still ride in those things.\r\n\"It might not be viable, so it might be a waste of money.\" Of course it might not be viable and might therefore be a waste of money. We might get to the prototype phase and then discover that the costs are actually prohibitive or one of the key technologies actually can\'t be developed. We might discover that people might not care enough about getting from San Francisco to L.A. in 35 minutes to allow the Hyperloop to charge enough to operate profitably. (If this happened, then the Hyperloop really would be like other transportation systems--Amtrak, for example). But all projects might not work. All projects might be a waste of money. That\'s why investing is risky. Again, if a requirement of any project be that it has to work, nothing would ever get done.\r\nIn short, all of those objections are the same sort of objections that you hear any time you suggest doing anything. None of them are obviously a good reason not to start work on the Hyperloop.\r\nAt the same time, there are many excellent reasons to start work immediately:\r\nThe Hyperloop would be the first truly revolutionary new transportation system in half a century.\r\nThe Hyperloop could radically change the time and cost equation for travel and transport between nearby cities.\r\nHyperloop technology, once perfected, could be sold and deployed worldwide.\r\nThe Hyperloop would create lots of jobs, from technology to manufacturing to construction to operation.\r\nThe Hyperloop would deploy some of the hoarded capital that is currently rotting away in corporate bank accounts, thus recirculating it into the economy.\r\nThe Hyperloop is an exciting, inspiring project that would command the attention of the world for years.  Don\'t underestimate the impact of this. People get excited about things that are cool, especially as they become reality.\r\nIs the Hyperloop actually technically feasible and would it work the way Elon Musk says it will work?\r\nI have no idea. I\'m not an engineer.\r\nBut so far, I have not heard any engineer say that what Musk describes is impossible. And a lot of what Musk has already accomplished in his lifetime might once have been described as \"basically impossible\" -- and that hasn\'t stopped it from happening.\r\nSo, come on, entrepreneurs and financiers!

It is not uncommon to throw banquets for guests (a gesture that should be returned at some point) and for business associates to argue over who will pick up a check. There will likely be frequent toasts during meals. The protocol: clink your glass below the rim of someone of a higher rank. Do not serve your own drink, but make sure to keep the glasses of those next to you full.

Being the boss takes a lot more than just hiring people. It takes a lot of business acumen. </p> <p>The first thing you need to do is to Hire Good People.  Many entrepreneurs make mistakes in this area. Small business owners tend to take on a lot of work themselves and hire only workers. This can lead to overwork and limitations in terms of expansion so you should look for people who can problem-solve, communicate lucidly and \"embrace\" your company\'s culture. \r\n</p> <p>\r\nSecondly, learn how to Communicate Clearly with your staff. \r\n</p> <p>\r\nMany first time business owners are unaccustomed with having to explain what\'s in their head and this can one of the main sources of confusion. Don\'t assume that your team can read your mind. Be clear and concise in your communication with them and clearly state your desired outcomes.\r\n</p> <p>\r\nThirdly, remember to Nurture Your Gifted Employees. \r\n</p> <p>\r\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take your talent employees for granted and don\'t forget to reward them when they take on greater responsibilities with commensurate compensation. Review your workforce for stars and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget to explore how you can add value for them too.\r\n</p> <p>\r\nFourthly, practice Thinking Outwardly and Ahead.\r\n</p> <p>\r\nGood bosses do not just look inward at their employees. They also scan the horizon and look out for changing industry trends. Set aside some time each week for a Ã¢â‚¬Å“360 look-a-roundÃ¢â‚¬Â for outside forces laying wait on the horizon that may disrupt your industry or change it irrevocably. \r\n</p> <p>\r\nLast but not least, Listen.\r\n</p> <p>\r\nListening to employees is one of smartest things you can do. They can expand your mind with richer ideas, suggest fixes to inefficiencies, and generally assist in extending your Ã¢â‚¬Å“reachÃ¢â‚¬Â far more effectively than you could on your own. \r\n</p> <p>\r\nThe next smartest thing is to listen to your customers. If any customer is interested enough in giving you feedback, they are emotionally invested in your business and are doing so to help you improve.\r\n</p> <p>\r\nAnybody can start up a business.

Statements such as \"That\'s not my job\",\"I\'m not on that project\",Ã‚Â and \"This is not my responsibility\" show an unwillingness to be a part of the team. In small companies, the \"not my job\" attitude is even more dangerous. Less desirable tasks have nowhere to be passed off and often end up overlooked entirely.

Many SME owners and even agents for established brands still have the misconception that anybody can do it  and end up hiring the wrong people to handle such accounts with the intention of cutting cost. Take for instance recent online events involving a certain mall and F&B business which went viral overnight for the wrong reasons, all because of a couple of poorly conceived comments and responses.  </p> <p> On top of the fiscal damage caused by an initial online firestorm, social media blunders leave a lasting impression online & immortalised in memes, blogs and on the walls of hundreds to even millions of users worldwide. That said, containing the situation and forking out extra money on damage control becomes almost illogical considering setting up a page on Facebook or Twitter can be cost free. A small business and an otherwise good reputation can be obliterated overnight by a single loose cannon online, make no mistake about that.  </p> <p> The (often forgotten) fact of the matter is, management of social media accounts and posts is a matter of Public Relations, and as such, it makes good sense to invest your resources in someone with a relevant educational background at very least. Such individuals can be expected to respond appropriately in tight situations, and quickly address any crisis that emerges on your public pages. While they may not necessarily be as easy on your budget as an untrained individual, they are an integral and worthwhile investment.  </p> <p> To help you look out for the right person you want on your team, here are some pointers.  </p> <p> First of all, ensure that the individual has a good command of the English language; dealing with online trolls pointing grammatical errors is not only a waste of time, but the fact that they pointed out errors on your page has the potential to cheapen your brand. Next, present your candidate with several challenging online scenarios to gauge how he or she handles a crisis under pressure, without offending anyone, or losing touch with your brand personality. Last but not least, do a background check on the persons existing social network pages to ensure that the person does not post any content that could potentially jeopardise your brand - at least on the surface, online stalking and extortion of private information is downright unethical. </p> <p> Remember, this person will be the face and voice of your company online, and will be required to engage visitors, not just placate them with one word responses and likes.

Lawyers use webcams for face-to-face meetings at a distance, retail chains inform consumers about their latest sales through Twitter, and even politicians and non-profit organisations are looking to connect to and expand their constituency using the Internet. In a world where Internet access is becoming as commonly available as electricity, what business could possibly afford to ignore the rapid pace of technology? Far from challenging, many of these new technologies make it easier than ever to reach out to new clients and modernise a business practically overnight. </p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Live Chat</strong></p>\r\n<p>Live chat is live support software which allows organisations to provide real-time assistance through instant messaging. While live chat has been mostly utilised by the tech help industry, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rapidly becoming one of the most important ways that small businesses can add a personal touch to their service. Deployed on websites either during business hours or with 24-hour service, live chat allows customers a direct line to a real person with any question they have regarding your services. Answering any pertinent questions that arise during browsing is one of the best ways to push customers further down the buyer cycle and closer to making their next purchase. </p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Twitter</strong></p>\r\n<p>Reaching out to potential customers that havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet found your content is incredibly easy through Twitter because posts (known as Tweets) can be categorised by tags. For example, following a natural disaster, users might post under the tag Ã¢â‚¬Å“#waterdamageÃ¢â‚¬Â. By dividing content into relevant tags and enabling users to search by category, Twitter gives businesses an inside look into the lives of their target demographics. While other social networking sites have comparably few ways to draw attention to your business aside from content sharing, correctly tagging your content through Twitter can enable you to engage markets that otherwise donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know you exist.  </p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Personalised E-mail</strong></p>\r\n<p>A staple of Internet marketing has always been e-mail, but the importance of this crucial tool is rapidly becoming even more important with the widespread use of opt-in newsletters. Merely by offering the ability to sign up for more information, you can cultivate a captive audience that will be as receptive to your message as anyone. E-mails are also an ideal way to re-engage prior customers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4: Comment Sections</strong></p>\r\n<p>ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long been known that customer feedback is a first rate source of search engine optimisation (or SEO) content. Adding a comment section or feedback form to your content may be intimidating at first, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost no better way to engage directly with your customers online. Once implemented, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re provided with a wealth of vital information about your current, former, and would-be clients. And, as the moderator of this section, you can request that commenters leave valid e-mail addresses which will give you the opportunity to engage with them again. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n'),(1102,92,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/banana-phone.jpg'),(1103,92,220,'BananaPhone'),(1104,92,221,'true'),(1105,92,224,'technology'),(1106,92,225,'blue'),(1107,93,191,'Stretching Ringgit Online'),(1108,93,193,'Stretching Ringgit Online'),(1109,93,197,'<p>Written By: Angel O.</p> <hr/> <p>There are two sides of the coin where it comes to making your money work for you online. It can be extremely cost effective, or extremely costly; and determining this boils down to your game plan. Online businesses are mushrooming around the world by the millions. These days, just about anybody can pay for the creation of a website, and that said, there\'s pretty stiff competition out there. </p> <p>To get you started, you first and foremost need a computer or server powerful enough to run your website or other online services. A constant \'server down\' message is definitely a turnoff to otherwise potential customers and visitors. </p>  <p>Next, you need to plan your website design carefully, to make it as user friendly as possibly. When in this stage, always remember that presentation is everything. Think of the website as your online \'office\', it must be presentable and welcoming to all visitors, to ensure they come back to do business with you. As a web-surfer yourself, I\'m sure you would immediately be put off by any website that looks dodgy in the slightest, as there are in fact many fly-by-night operations out there looking to make a quick buck. That said, quality web-designing is no doubt costly, but will be well worth it in the long run. </p>  <p>Once your site is up and running, you should consider investing in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), which will help you, first and foremost, boost your site\'s ranking on search engines such as Google and Yahoo; making it easier to find for those seeking products or services you offer. It would be a crying shame to beautiful website which only appears on the third page of a Google search, which we all know will probably be ignored by a majority of people online. It\'s good to be on the first page, and even better to be right on top of it. </p>  <p>Beyond that, integration is of great importance when establishing your online presence, and by this we mean making all your web pages and social network pages interconnected (this doesn\'t have to cost much). However, a common problem with many businesses is that different divisions are assigned different pages. As such, inconsistent messages are disseminated, causing confusion among visitors and customers. Worse still, conflicting profiles and posts will immediately give people reason to doubt your credibility.

Trouble is: they\'re not that disposable. If you really want to be righteous the plastic lid has to go into the plastic bin for recycling while the paper part needs to be separated into the paper bin. It\'s a lot of work, a major time factor in the millisecond coffee breaks allotted in offices of the new millennium.  </p> <p> All that traipsing back and forth to various recycling bins is enough to make the world\'s hurried billions to want to flip their caffeinated lids; or, worst case: roast like a bean in Litter Bug Hell for a billion and one eternities.  </p> <p> But, hold on, there\'s hope! </p> <p> Two years ago, architect Peter Herman recalls how he began each day toting a ceramic mug from his former home in the Bay Area to a nearby Peet\'s coffee shop. \"Bringing in our mugs is what we all did to be green\",Ã‚Â he said. He vowed at the time that were he ever forced to break down and use a disposable cup, at least he would crush it up, thereby reducing the amount of landfill required to accommodate one the 400 hundred billions trashed. If we had a window on him prior to his moment of discovery, we would have seen him playing with the cup, slowly, meditatively crushing it before going to work designing research labs and medical schools.  </p> <p> The AHA moment finally came to him at a Peet\'s in Boston: what if he could fold the cup in such a way as to make it spill-proof, but also with a spout? Wouldn\'t this completely do away with the need for a plastic lid? How many tons of trash would a lidless cup eliminate from our shores? He kept folding, this way and that. Not only would such a cup save mountains of plastic, a paper spout would allow him to drink the last Ã‚Â¼ cup rather than pressing his proboscis onto a flat lid!  </p> <p> Many folds later, Herman had still not worked out the complex perforations in the folding process. </p> <p> An architect, as opposed to an industrial designer, cup manufacturing was a little out of his line. Even culturally, the project seemed like a long shot. Wouldn\'t this be something that the Japanese could work out? Their packaging is so far ahead, their ingenious origami paper folding so much a part of their DNA.  </p> <p> \"But I just kept at it\",Ã‚Â says Peter, who left off folding in real life and started folding virtually with the advanced 3-D modeling software in his office. Thousands of permutations later he had it: The Compleat Cup (many patents pending).

While most people know the immediate risk of getting busted and taken to task for using such software, many are still unaware of how extensive the damage can really be. Keep in mind the old adage that Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnothing comes for freeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. While on the surface, free software might seem a great low-cost solution, often, the ill-effects are noticed over prolonged usage. Ironically, even fake antivirus programs can do more good than harm to your systems.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the heart of the problem is a cocktail of adware, spyware and malware which allow otherwise restricted third parties access to your system and private files. The people that create these Trojans are a conniving bunch, and you most likely wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t notice anything amiss, until itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile some infections are Ã¢â‚¬ËœbenignÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, designed to merely tamper with your system by way of duplicating files to slow down a system over time, the most dangerous forms of adware have the ability to wipe out entire networks and even your nerve-centre in the form of a server. That, obviously is going to cost a bomb, and will slow down progress, costing you even more. Even worse, some tamper with your firewall and existing software (even if it is original) and leave your systems vulnerable to hackers, worldwide, waiting to get their hands on your private information, passwords, and bank accounts. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat are the chances you ask? Well, according to a 2013 report by the IDC (International Data Corporation), a whopping 78% of the software downloaded from peer to peer (P2P) networks is infected with spyware, and malicious adware 36% of the time. As such, it is estimated that some 1.5 billion hours have been wasted this year alone dealing with the resulting effects, and losses resulting from data breaches are predicted to hit a staggering US$350 billionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the tip of the iceberg.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the full report for your perusal:<br/>\r\nwww.microsoft.com/en-us/news/download/presskits/antipiracy/docs/IDC030513.pdf\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith that in mind, do think twice the next time someone utters: Ã¢â‚¬Å“aiyah, torrent lah!Ã¢â‚¬Â Paying for original software comes with not only peace of mind, but also access to updates that improve them over time and customer service, making it a worthwhile investment. \r\n</p><p></p>\r\n'),(1303,98,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/easy-ride.jpg'),(1304,98,220,'Torrent'),(1305,98,221,'false'),(1306,98,224,'technology'),(1307,98,225,'red'),(1348,99,191,'APPlicable?'),(1349,99,193,'APPlicable?'),(1350,99,197,' <p>Written by Angel O.</p> <hr> <p> \"There\'s an app for everything these day\" they say, but what about you? You\'ve probably got a website running and quite possibly a few social network pages too, so the next logical step is to have an app, is it not? It is something worth considering, as there are many advantages to being accessible in the palm of everybody\'s hand. However, before we get to the whole software development mumbo-jumbo, first and foremost take into consideration if your company has the infrastructure and manpower to handle the new medium.   </p><p> Depending on the nature of the app you want to develop, the challenges can range from few to many. Some of the simplest you might begin working with involve the basic update app, which keeps your customers updated on your latest news, online stores, catalogues, and even combinations of all of the above. It really depends how far you want to take it, and what your budget allows. Meanwhile, from a totally different perspective, your business itself could revolve around an app, or you could even create one as a side business.  </p><p> Now, let\'s say we have decided on the app we\'d like to develop, and have a blueprint on the table. The next step would be to decide on a look and feel, and this, is where the \'make or break\' part of the process comes in. The main reasons behind apps that fail are usually a \'lack of user-friendliness\' or \'incompatible with my operating system\'. Look through the comments on a majority of the apps in the store, be you an Apple or Android user, and you\'ll be sure to see the two aforementioned complaints all over the place.  </p><p> While the idea of \'modern technology\' would make anyone want to go all-out with an all rounded app right from the start, doing so, especially if you\'re new to the processes involved, can be incredibly challenging especially with limited resources. On the other hand, you are right to believe that there will most definitely be copycats out there with more resources able to take your idea and present a better version.  </p><p> This is where the ability to continuously upgrade your app and having the manpower to do so becomes indispensable. While you might only be able to present part of what you originally envisioned on the drawing board, it helps tremendously to have plans for the future in hand - giving you an edge over the competition. In fact, many users look forward to updates in terms of graphics and features as smartphones continue to evolve; meaning staying relevant on the app market will be an on-going challenge.  </p><p> That said, there is no harm in starting small and testing the waters first (sometimes, even the simplest apps get millions of downloads simply because of the convenience they offer), as long as you\'ve planned in advance for further development. Also, developing a great app involves taking into consideration valuable user feedback, and having a good grasp on what is offered by competitors, so keep your eyes peeled.   </p><p></p>'),(1351,99,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/Applicable.png'),(1352,99,220,'Applicable'),(1353,99,221,'false'),(1354,99,224,'technology'),(1355,99,225,'blue'),(1388,100,191,'Please Sir, I Want Some More'),(1389,100,193,'Please Sir, I Want Some More'),(1390,100,197,'<p>Written by Angel O.</p> <hr> <p> LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s be realistic about the whole giving a raise thing.

But if carried out correctly, it could also mean reaping the rewards of your own hard work and being your own boss. And you ask, \"How do I go about achieving it successfully?\"Ã‚Â </p><p> Well, like all things in life, you need to take note of a few things and to follow a well-thought-out plan. </p><p> <strong>So, What\'s Your Business Idea? </strong></p><p> Before you can start up a business, you will need a business idea that address a particular consumer need that has not yet been filled by any other businesses. Or, you need to come up with an idea that offers a better solution for an existing consumer need or service? </p><p>  <strong>Is It Plausible?</strong></p><p> Before you go spending all your life savings on your new business idea, think about how plausible your idea is. Is it something costumers are willing to pay for? Will it turn enough of a profit to be viable? Is it possible to implement? </p><p>   <strong>How Unique Is Your Idea?</strong></p><p> Being unique will help you successfully eliminate or significantly combat competition.

Yes, there are entrepreneurs out there who operate unregistered, but from a taxation and legal standpoint, as long as you are earning money from any source, while you are in Malaysia, you are legally required to be registered with the Suruhanjaya Syarikat Malaysia (SSM)/(Companies Commission of Malaysia). But what kinds of businesses need to be registered?  </p><p> But what kind of registration is needed how do you decide on which one is best for you?  </p><p>  The first thing you would need to consider is what type of registration you will need for your new venture.

So, which registration is right for your business?  </p><p>  There are generally three (3) types of business registration that can set up in Malaysia, namely:  i) A Sole Proprietorship (Enterprise) ii) Partnership - Private Limited (Sdn Bhd) iii) Limited Liability Partnership.  </p><p>  <strong>Sole Proprietorship (Enterprise) </strong>registration is best for businesses that are wholly owned by a single individual using a personal name as per his or her Malaysian Identity Card or trade name. </p><p>  <strong>Partnership - Private Limited (Sdn Bhd) </strong>covers businesses owned by two or more persons but not exceeding 20 people and the name found on one\'s identity card cannot be used as the business name. </p><p>  <strong>Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) </strong>registrations are an alternative business vehicle that combines the characteristics of a company and a conventional partnership.  It is useful for start-ups, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to grow their businesses without having to worry too much on their personal liabilities, personal assets and strict compliance requirements. </p><p>  Each of these types of registrations has their own merits and the best type to register very much depends on the nature of your business partnership, the size of your organisation and even in some cases, the type of business that you will be engaged.  </p><p>  Take note of this, as your decision will affect the extent of the potential legal responsibilities that you will be faced with or have to be responsible for.    </p><p></p>'),(1447,103,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/calendar.jpg'),(1448,103,220,'calendar'),(1449,103,221,'true'),(1450,103,224,'entrepreneurship'),(1451,103,225,'blue'),(1460,104,191,'How To Keep Girlfriends & Customers Happy'),(1461,104,193,'How To Keep Girlfriends & Customers Happy'),(1462,104,197,'<p>Written by Damien Ong</p><hr><p> Getting a customer to buy your product once is easy and often comes down to luck.

What he\'s doing is catering to the Product Demand.  </p><p>  A common mistake often made by entrepreneurs is they focus too much on selling what they believe is the best product in the world instead of what the customers wants The best way to achieve this is by exploring the market thoroughly and ascertaining what it is that they really want (benefits), not what it is you want to sell to them (features), or can get a good deal on (cheap stock). After all, there\'s no point in obtaining a supply of something cheap if nobody wants to purchase it later.  </p><p>  Next, everybody always has his or her favorite DVD guy.

He\'s practicing Brand Loyalty.   </p><p>   In fact, many entrepreneurs fail because they look at their customers as just that customers; walking ATMs, not human beings. Engage with your customers, find out what they like or dislike about your business and the product(s) you are selling and always accept criticism as a point that they care enough to give you feedback. </p><p>  You know the guy who sits up front, the lookout with the walkie-talkie?

Fortune awarded him manager of the century for his genius. However, when other companies emulated his annual cleansing effort, it didn\'t succeed as hoped. They got sued; there was a drop in employees morale and productivity suffered. Why didn\'t it produce a similar outcome? </p><p> Well, Jack Welch was initially unsuccessful in his transformation of GE. The press nicknamed him Neutron Jack and his employees hated him.  Despite the restructuring, there were minimal results in the early years.  </p><p> He got rid of 118,000 people, but middle managers would rehire them as temporary workers, consultants or contractors. Everything Welch did, was sometimes undone by his own employees. Until he realised that it was not the restructuring strategies but rather the execution of it. Employees need to be part of the execution process or the transformation wouldn\'t work. So, instead of just having a structural transformation, he devoted his time to a cultural transformation.  He picked pieces of culture that were hurting his renewal process and addressed it. Slowly, as the culture of GE changed, the transformation happened.  </p><p> WorkOut, his first big initiative, addressed lack of ownership and drove productivity. His job rotational policy addressed the issue of employees being content and resistant to change and also produced a dynamic breed of leaders. His bottom 10% policy, addressed the performance culture issue. Each cultural issue he aced was addressed with cultural initiatives, culminating in huge investments in his nerveÃ‚Â centre for culture called Crotonville. </p><p> Many companies emulated the initiatives like WorkOut and Crotonville, or used his bottom 10% policy. What they did not understand was that each initiative implemented by Welch wasn\'t a stand-alone initiative. Each initiative drove cultural change in the organization.  So, copying what GE did, when the culture of the organization was different, brought little benefit to the organization, as Ford and numerous other copycats found out to their peril!  This theory of culture before process or strategic change is not new.  </p><p> <strong>Psychologists term this the Broken Window theory</strong> </p><p> In 1992, there were 2,154 murders in New York City and 626,182 serious crimes committed. Within five years, the murders had dropped by almost 70% and serious crimes had reduced by 50%. David Gunn and William Bratton, two key players in the transformation practiced the Broken Window theory. The theory states that culture, rather than bad people, is the key reason for crime.  Gunn and Bratton focused on the New York City subway system.  </p><p> They eliminated petty crime, fixed broken windows and removed graffiti in the city.  It was as simple as cleaning up the image of the city, creating a new visible culture, which was soon embraced by the city. </p><p>  If you want to spearhead a transformation in your organization, don\'t forget to focus on the culture.  The success of your change has nothing to do with the brilliance of your change strategy. It really depends on your cultural strategy.  </p><p> Just fix your broken windowsÃ‚Â and remember, culture matters!  </p><p></p> <p></p> <p> <p>Brought to you by:</p> <p><img src=\"/sites/ABS/img/logo/leadernomics-logo.png\"></p><p>This article was previously published in myStarjob.com in The Star.

A  Malaysian CEO recently mentioned that it\'s almost impossible to win. We try to kill our competition but they seem to be mushrooming everywhere! We fail to realize that the way to win now has become significantly different because the new world calls for a different set of rules. </p><p> In 2005, MGM, BMG and other entertainment companies sued Grokster, Napster, Kazaa, eMule and other small companies providing peer-to-peer (P2P) services, allowing users to share music and software files over the Internet. However, even though they kept winning these legal battles, more P2P companies were set up all over the world.  </p><p>  Then emerged a winner, Apple. Instead of trying to killÃ‚Â P2P applications, Apple adopted a legalised P2P model by striking a deal with recording labels to allow users to download files at marginal fees via iTunes. Apple reinvented the conventional model by building a collaborative model.  </p><p>  The Huffington Post has grown to be a major online newspaper by leveraging the power of collaborative journalism. It has huge reach and only employs a total staff of 50. It has more than 1,800 volunteersÃ‚Â who write daily for free from all over world. Wikipedia was launched online as the free encyclopedia that anyone can editÃ‚Â; it has since become the largest depository of information. It is run by the general public and not a CEO.  </p><p>  Another example of a collaborative organisation is Mozilla, who competes against Microsoft, Apple and Google at the same time as it collaborates with them. Mozilla\'s Firefox has no employees while Microsoft hires top engineers, yet Firefox gets updated daily by volunteers. In fact, in 2004, Mozilla users banded together and raised US$250,000 to help advertise the release of Firefox 1.0 in The New York Times.  </p><p>  Leaders that embrace a collaborative model understand that success is not built on killing the competitionÃ‚Â because the collective wisdom of the world always produces better innovative output.  </p><p>  So how can I apply this to my organisation? If you have a problem and need a plan, your best bet is often to throw together a group of talented individuals and let their collective creative energy go to work. Collaboration works through a combination of passion and purpose, so get people who deeply care about the issue and have a vested interest in solving it.  </p><p>  Collaboration is not new. Early history suggests that tribal systems of collaboration and cooperation, based on trust and kinship, were the norm. This predates the power and competition-based hierarchies of today. The effectiveness of collaborative movements like the leaderless Alcoholic Anonymous touches millions through shared ideology and highlights that the future depends on your collaborative capability. </p><p>  The Internet has created a collaborative infrastructure and interface for the 21st century. People can participate in the economy like never before. The skills of leadership in the future will be about sharing everything with everyone and trusting people to support and grow with you. So stop being obsessed with killingÃ‚Â your competition.

They are visionaries and experts who are isolated from the organisation. This image reinforces the sense that it\'s lonely at the top. Leaders, we assume, need to be slightly disconnected in order to take charge and remain objective.  </p><p> Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. Our very greatest leaders are anything but disconnected. Rather than positioning themselves at the top of the organisation, they embed themselves at its heart and surround themselves with the people they work with. They recognise that bonding, which I define as an attachment that creates energy, is the key to great leadership.  </p><p>  It is precisely this interpersonal bonding that brings out the best in others and makes them want to follow; it is the difference between managing tasks and leading people. When employees describe the most influential leaders they have worked for, they don\'t use words such as \'detached\', \'distant\'Ã‚Â or \'individualistic\',Ã‚Â instead; they use adjectives that reflect high bonding: \'supportive\', \'caring\'Ã‚Â, \'fair\'Ã‚Â and \'accessible\'Ã‚Â.  </p><p>  Detached leaders foster environments that are unlikely to be creative and unable to sustain long-term results. They consciously or unconsciously end up dominating those with whom they work and in the process disengage from those around them. Certainly, these leaders feel lonely.  </p><p>  When it involves bonding, leadership is like belayingÃ‚Â, a safety mechanism used in rock climbing. In the two-person version of this technique, the belayer acts as a \'secure base\'Ã‚Â, positioning him or herself at the bottom. The climber is attached to one end of the rope and the belayer, using a device clipped to his harness, holds the other end of the rope so that the climber has enough slack to move, but not enough to fall any great distance. As the climber advances upwards, the belayer remains at the bottom to secure the climber and take up slack in the rope as needed. The climber, like an employee, can take risks because the secure base figure or leader below provides a powerful combination of safety and stretch.  </p><p>  This metaphor conveys the sense of a leader leading from below rather than above. It captures the power of connection and attachment between leaders and others who is recognised as a strong, trustworthy and dependable base that encourages employees to climb high and reach their full potential. I call these leaders Secure Bases who form bonds from trust and care, and dare people to go further than they have. They inspire others and unleash potential in their organisations and because their psychological presence is what counts more than their physical presence, they are secure bases to thousands of employees. Far from being lonely, these great leaders are bonded with people, often many, many people, on a deep level.  </p><p>  It\'s time that we stopped lauding those leaders who claw their way to the top and remain there in detached isolation. Instead of focusing on advancement involving a leader\'s own vertical ascent, let\'s focus on how they help others climb and achieve great results.  </p> <hr> <p> Dr George Kohlrieser is a professor of Leadership and Organisational Behaviour at IMD, a former hostage negotiator, and author of the award-winning bestseller Hostage at the Table.

I would quickly then grab a torch-light and sneak under the blanket to start reading my favorite super-hero comics, The Amazing Spider-Man. I loved reading my Spider-Man comics. The stories were so interesting and Peter Parker (aka Spider-Man) was one of the most human super heroes I have ever encountered. </p><p> And so, I decided to list seven leadership lessons that I learnt from Parker. Here\'s my list: </p><p>  <strong>1. Be human at all times. Be yourself.</strong></p><p> Many leaders believe that just because they have big titles and are leaders, they need to act differently and try to avoid human emotions. Parker struggled at many occasions having to behave like a heroÃ‚Â and not himself. In fact, it caused significant issues with his marriage to Mary Jane. As leaders, we should never wear masks, especially when dealing with relationships and matters of the heart. </p><p>  <strong>2. Take responsibility</strong></p><p> Great leaders take responsibility for their actions, especially the mistakes and failures. Spider-Man leads by example and he not only owns up to his shortcomings and failures, he never blamed others. As his Uncle Ben reminded him ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwith great power comes great responsibility. Many leaders don\'t realise how much power they hold in their hands. Your employees look up to you. As leaders, every word muttered is analysed and repeated throughout your department or organisation. </p><p>  <strong>3. Always smile</strong></p><p> Spider-Man is always smiling (well, he is in his suit) in spite of the horrible burden he carries and the pain in his life. It takes some doing to be the \'friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\'.Ã‚Â Yet almost all great leaders wear a smile on their face constantly. I met Nobel Prize winner Mohamad Yunus, who was going through some painful times with his government. Yet, when we met over breakfast, he smiled throughout the meeting. Great leaders go through tremendous moments of pain and suffering just like all of us do.  </p><p>  <strong>4. Keep serving others - that is the essence of leadership</strong></p><p> Service of others always yields benefits. In the latest Amazing Spider-Man movie, we see how the web-crawler needs the help of a number of crane operators. The help came to him in the moment of need as the crane foreman was the father of a boy Spider-Man had rescued earlier in the movie. It is far more blessed to serve and to give than to receive. </p><p>  <strong>5. Keep persevering</strong></p><p> Never let adversity and pain deter you. Spider-Man has a torrid life with things never working out. Yet, he never let that be an excuse to give up. He kept going and never gave in to the doubt that crept into his mind. Perseverance pays off whether you are building a business or growing your career. You have to keep going and going and things will ultimately go your way. </p><p>  <strong>6. Leadership does not come free</strong></p><p> Many leaders forget the cost of leadership. Being a leader requires you to sacrifice time, money, efforts and endure struggles and pain. We always talk about the benefits of leadership, but we fail to count the cost of it. Spider-Man understood the cost of being a superhero. He lost many things including his privacy and family. As leaders, have we counted the cost of leadership? </p><p>  <strong>7. You don\'t need to lead all the time</strong></p><p> Spidey is the type who is not a natural leader. Yet in times of crisis or when he is required to lead, he steps up and leads. In many occasions, Spider-Man lets others lead. He seamlessly moves from being a loyal and dedicated follower to being a decisive and respected leader. We all can learn to play different roles at different stages in our organisation. Do we let others lead? And do we know when we need to step in and resume leadership? </p><p>   <strong>Final thoughts There are many more lessons that you can learn from Spider-Man. But the most important thing about lessons is to internalise them and leverage them in our lives. So, keep learning and smiling. I wish you a \'spidey\' career and a wonderful leadership journey ahead.   </p><p> <p>Brought to you by:</p> <p><img src=\"/sites/ABS/img/logo/leadernomics-logo.png\"></p><p>This article was previously published in myStarjob.com in The Star.

I remember numerous superficial relationships with senior company officers assigned to me through official mentorship programmes that never yielded much value. Nonetheless, the few mentorship relationships that worked were not one-sided but beneficial to both. </p><p> When I took on a new role at media company NBC, there was no official mentorship program. I then decided to take matters into my own hands and create my own by sending emails to all their senior leaders asking them to help me develop. Most responded positively but almost all evolved into short-term mentorÃ‚Â because they viewed the relationship as one-way: they give, I receive. There was one exception, the leader in-charge of growing NBC\'s business in Asia, who kept picking my brains. We met weekly and this mentorship relationship benefited him as much as it helped me settle into NBC and accelerated my career. Therein lies the secret to successful mentorship - it has to be beneficial both ways and there has to be a \'what\'s in it for me\'Ã‚Â (WIIFM) for both mentee and mentor.  </p><p>  A number of organisations realise the need to ensure that WIIFM is part of the mentorship equation. So, some are shifting into reverse by asking tech-savvy junior employees to teach the \'old dogs\'Ã‚Â new tricks. I experienced this first-hand in a technology role at GE, where former CEO Welch picked a junior IT person to teach him everything about the Internet. He quickly learnt from his mentorÃ‚Â and then ordered top managers to find mentorsÃ‚Â who were Internet-savvy. And reverse-mentoring took off.  </p><p>  Procter & Gamble\'s former CIO Steve David also began a reverse-mentoring relationship with a staff scientist to learn more about how science and toxicology affect business decisions. Reverse mentoring helps counter our natural tendency to be over-reliant on our experiences. Also, most senior leaders have limited insights as to what happens at the manufacturing shop floor or in the frontlines of customer service operations. Having these employees mentor senior leaders enables them to have quick access to what is happening on the ground and insights on operations or the supply chain.  </p><p>  Wharton Business School matches its executive MBAs with junior mentors, mostly junior students with an excellent grasp of technology. Executives are beginning to realise that knowledge isn\'t a one-way street. \"It\'s in everyone\'s best interest to share expertise,Ã‚Â\" said Jerry Wind, director of the Wharton program.  </p><p>    FastCompany magazine notes, \"It\'s a situation where the old fogies in an organisation realise that by the time you are in your 40s and 50s, you are not in touch with the future the same way the young 20-somethings are. They come with fresh eyes, open minds and instant links to the technology of the future.Ã‚Â\" Younger people know social media and latest trends but don\'t have business experiences or visibility in an organisation. Senior leaders have that business experience but don\'t necessarily have the social media knowledge or insights on the future. It\'s a simple win-win for both, right?  </p><p> <p>Brought to you by:</p> <p><img src=\"/sites/ABS/img/logo/leadernomics-logo.png\"></p><p>This article was previously published in myStarjob.com in The Star.

By joining the already existing workforce, these fresh graduates are trying hard to make the right decisions; decisions that may well shape the rest of their career as well as their future and that of their family.  </p> <p> The workforce no longer looks at salary and benefits as reasons for staying in a company. Instead, career opportunities, performance management, brand alignment and work life balance seem to be the key drivers of keeping employees engaged to the organisation. As a result of a global study by Hewitt Associates, there seem to be five common characteristics among best employers around the world. Let\'s look at these five in detail: </p> <p> <strong>Inspired Leadership</strong></p> <p> Best employers around the world tend to have leadership teams that set the example for commitment to their people. Even though at times taxing and frustrating, they ensure that they maintain visibility, they provide clarity and focus and they encourage openness and involvement. </p> <p> <strong>Unique Company Culture</strong></p> <p> Best employers around the world articulate and maintain a unique organisational culture, ensuring that all new hires have a \'cultural fit\' to the organisation. They create a unique employment experience and emphasise on promotion from within the ranks of the organisation. Best employers embrace a culture of high performance, they stress company values, and have systems and practices designed to inspire their workforce to do their best.  </p> <p> <strong>Focus on Growing Talent </strong></p> <p>  Best employers provide more opportunities for their workforce to develop and grow professionally and personally. They place much attention on identifying high potential talent and ensure they receive the right training and development, as well as provide them with frequent opportunities to meet the senior leadership. Training provided should include leadership and technical skills, but also education on the company culture and values.  </p><p><strong> Strong Sense of Accountability</strong></p><p> Holding employees accountable for results and recognizing achievements instill a great sense of responsibility. Employees in turn have a clear understanding of what is expected of them because of the frequent communication from leaders on the business direction and company goals. Their roles are therefore constantly aligned in order to keep up. A strong sense of accountability is created by setting clear expectations, a rigorous performance management program, putting emphasis on fair play and ownership opportunities.  </p> <p> <strong> Aligned HR Practices and Excellent Execution</strong></p> <p>  The HR programs and practices are relevant to the business, as well as valuable to the employees. High value programmes are identified and promoted in order to drive employee engagement and business success. Such programmes are executed effectively, through careful planning, dedicated resources, excellent communication, and effective allotment of time. </p> <p>  Going back to where we started, a good employer is one that provides the right foundations for strong, sustainable employee engagement. An employer that provides the aforementioned structures, processes and opportunities is likely to be more cherished by its workforce than one that doesn\'t.  </p> <p> <p>Brought to you by:</p> <p><img src=\"/sites/ABS/img/logo/leadernomics-logo.png\"></p><p>This article was previously published in myStarjob.com in The Star.

So at the very first board meeting, the vice-president in charge of marketing arrived with a very impressive presentation. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a full half-hour of showing colorful charts and going through a detailed analysis of the drill bit market, the vice-president finally sat down, thoroughly satisfied with the brilliant presentation. At which point the new CEO sighed, stood up, and simply proclaimed, \"There is no market for drill bits. The market is for holes.\" And then he walked out of the room.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHenry Ford understood that there was no market for the horse and buggy; the market was for transportation.

In truth, their education is just beginning. </p> <p>  Lifelong learning is a trait found in most (if not all) successful people, especially leaders. Leaders are constantly seeking to improve themselves and grasp new ideas. Never satisfied with where they are, they are always striving for more.  </p> <p>  Here are five characteristics of leaders who are committed to lifelong learning. </p> <p>  <strong>1.	Lifelong learners are readers. </strong> </p> <p>  Most leaders are readers. As a popular axiom states, if you\'re not reading, you\'re not leading. Lifelong learners will consistently read new material, balancing it between such categories as professional development, self-improvement, bestsellers, classic literature, history, and general knowledge. </p> <p>  <strong>2.	Lifelong learners attend growth-oriented events. </strong> </p> <p>  Leaders make it a priority to regularly participate in conferences where they can learn new ideas and strategies. They realise that change is unavoidable and that there is always more to learn. At least once a year, they attend a conference, either specific to their industry or more general such as the leadership summits. But they don\'t just attend; they actively participate and take notes with the goal of growing beyond where they are at the start. </p> <p>  <strong>3.	Lifelong learners record their insights.</strong> </p> <p>  Several studies have demonstrated how we learn a little when we hear something, more when we hear it and see it, and most when we hear it, see it, and write it down. Whether a lifelong learner is gleaning something from a book or from experience, the best way to internalise it is to write it down. </p> <p>  <strong>4.	Lifelong learners learn from others. </strong> </p> <p>  Pride can convince some that they cannot learn from those around them, but lifelong learners are always willing to absorb lessons from others. They will even be willing to learn from those in subordinate positions and with less education or experience. They refuse to allow pride to get in the way of a learning opportunity. </p> <p>  <strong>5.	Lifelong learners grow through failure.</strong> </p> <p>  Failure is perhaps the best teacher (or at least the most effective teacher) of lifelong learners. Those who learn and grow through failure often find themselves positioned for future success. Steve Jobs learned from the struggles faced by Apple during the 1990s and went on to turn the company into a powerhouse in the computer industry. Donald Trump emerged from bankruptcy to become one of the most powerful figures in real estate. Abraham Lincoln used the lessons from his political failures to turn him into the greatest president in American history. Failure is never preferred, but it can be a great teacher. </p> <p>  The trait of being a lifelong learner cannot be overestimated. Those who are not learning are declining. Leaders\' intent on moving forward and achieving future success will be devoted to lifelong learning.  </p> <p></p>'),(1932,125,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/learn-and-lead.jpg'),(1933,125,220,'Lifetime Learners'),(1934,125,221,'false'),(1935,125,224,'leadership-and-management'),(1936,125,225,'blue'),(1953,126,191,'Leading With Your Eyes'),(1954,126,193,'Leading With Your Eyes'),(1955,126,197,'<p>Written by Greg H.</p> <hr> <p> Perhaps more than anyone else, leaders can fall prey to hypercriticism. When a leader sits in a meeting, attends a conference, or examines the way another business operates, he or she can\'t help but notice all the ways things could have been done differently; that is, better. </p> <p>  While this critical eye and attention to detail is the product of a creative mind, it can become de-motivating and eventually lead to cynicism. When this happens to a leader, that person ceases to be a leader. To avoid this pitfall, it is essential that a leader take action in response to his or her observations. </p> <p>  When you see something that could be done better and in a more efficient way, write it down. Even if it is not relevant to you at the moment, it may become relevant to you later on. When you see a problem, record your solution. Begin with the words, \'I would\'Ã‚Â and proceed to describe how you would address the situation if you were the one in charge. </p> <p>  Perhaps you can enact your ideas immediately. You might discover practical applications for your creativity in your own setting. Your observations may be used to improve the image, increase the productivity, and aid in communication within your business. </p> <p>  Alternatively, keep your notes in an \'idea file\'.Ã‚Â As you accumulate more and more ideas, you will want to organise your notes into a more complete filing system. Label files as \'conferences\',Ã‚Â \'hospitality\',Ã‚Â \'displays\',Ã‚Â or whatever else might be appropriate in your situation. As you do, you will develop a reservoir of ideas to draw from in the future personally or when a friend or colleague asks for your advice. </p> <p>  Ultimately, harnessing your ideas like this can greatly increase your personal motivation. Instead of become cynical and discouraged, you will discover creative solutions that will spur you on to great heights and make you a more effective leader.  </p> <p></p>'),(1956,126,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/leading-with-eyes.jpg'),(1957,126,220,'Leading with your eyes'),(1958,126,221,'false'),(1959,126,224,'leadership-and-management'),(1960,126,225,'red'),(1969,127,191,'The Art of Making Money with Your Customers\' Mouth'),(1970,127,193,'The Art of Making Money with Your Customers\' Mouth'),(1971,127,197,'<p>Written by C.K. Goh</p> <hr> <p> Among small business tips, the efficient use of word of mouth marketing is one of the most important. Social media marketing, standard marketing, and whatever else you can think of all of these are vastly improved with just a few adjustments. While advertisements and marketing will give you results, word of mouth marketing is where you can find real gains. A recommendation from a company or advertisement is good but a recommendation from a friend is better. </p> <p>  <strong>Simply Ask Your Clients to Help</strong> </p> <p>  Referrals are powerful, but most people have an issue with simply asking clients or friends to refer them. There is no issue here if what you believe you\'re offering something of real value. You\'ll have to give them information, such as your business\'s long-term goals and how they can benefit from referring your business. Of course, you should also help them along by giving them the information they need to recommend you, such as contact information, business cards, and the like. </p> <p>  If you can, focus on big names. If you can have an influential client or friend, the recommendation will be heard and followed by more people.  </p> <p>  <strong>Be Amazing</strong> </p> <p>  Another way to help maximise or further improve your word of marketing efforts is to put more effort into your business. Nothing makes a person recommend a business better or faster than a good experience with them. This means going above and beyond what they expect of you and your company.  </p> <p>  Excellent, responsive, and friendly customer service is a good place to start. You can also be helpful to your clients and not necessarily in a way that will help your company directly. Talk to your clients so you know their needs better, and tell them it is so you can provide a more customised and personalised experience and service for them. </p> <p>  <strong>Develop Relationships with Your Clients and Customers</strong> </p> <p>  Just like an amazing business, a friendly business can also encourage clients to talk about your business. Be respectful and honest, and make sure that your employees are the same. Essentially, you\'re looking to make your clients a friend of your business. This can also result in return business, which means more money coming into your company. </p> <p>  <strong>Utilise Word of Mouth Marketing to Help Your Clients</strong> </p> <p>  If you scratch their back, they\'ll be more likely to scratch yours. Some of your clients and customers will undoubtedly have business ventures of their own. Why not give them a helping hand? Refer them to people who are looking for services. Hopefully, that will entice them to make referrals on your behalf as well. As your business grows, your network of contacts will grow as well, allowing you to refer more people and have more people refer you in kind. </p> <p>  Word of mouth marketing is a classic and still relevant form of marketing and as long as people trust the word of their friends and experts, it will always be relevant. Businesses, small and large, will always be able to use word of mouth to improve their standing. Those looking for small business tips may have found the one they can use today  this one.  </p> <p></p>'),(1972,127,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/customers-mouth.jpg'),(1973,127,220,'Teeth'),(1974,127,221,'false'),(1975,127,224,'marketing'),(1976,127,225,'red'),(1977,128,191,'Market your company online!

Launch a blog and become the voice of your industry.  There are many popular blogging platforms that are free. Decide what you want to say, and commit to posting regularly. For example, explain an innovation in your category.  Share the learning from a recent conference.  Urge lawmakers to pass legislation that will improve the business and consumer landscape.  By establishing yourself as a knowledgeable and engaging resource, involved readers may quickly turn into your customers, partners and suppliers.  And fresh, relevant content will increase traffic to your site and improve your search engine ranking. </p> <p>  <strong>SOCIAL = SALES</strong> </p> <p> Open social media accounts for your business.  It\'s free to do so and your activity in these communities can immediately affect your bottom line.  Promote a new product via Pinterest, Tumblr, or YouTube.  Communicate with a customer via Facebook.  Join a professional group on LinkedIn.  Weigh in on an industry issue via Twitter.  Pin, post, and tweet faithfully and engaged followers may recommend you to everyone in their social networks. </p> <p>  <strong>BE QUOTABLE</strong> </p> <p> Transform an online article from ho-hum to trending by supplying its author with a succinct and unique quote.  Remember the three P\'s: lead with personality, be positive, and make your quote powerful.  If you\'ve delivered, what you say will appear in larger type as the pull quote  jumping out at the reader and pulling them in.  And no news outlet is too small.  Sure, pitch yourself to the major sites, but introduce yourself to bloggers and freelance writers, too.  Because your name and business will appear with the quote, ask the author to hyperlink them, so readers are one click away from your Web site. </p> <p>  <strong>RIVAL THE LATE NIGHT GIANTS</strong> </p> <p> Have a webcam?

These days, the opposite holds true. Products need people to survive. Unless your business has lots of customers, it will not last. </p> <p>  Because your products or services must have a constant supply of customers to thrive, it\'s important that you understand exactly what they value most.  So what satisfies their needs, wants and aspirations?  </p> <p>  As a business owner, you cannot afford to simply guess the answers. These complex questions can only be answered by your customers themselves.  Phone them, meet with them or conduct formal market research.  Whatever you do, make sure you ask enough questions to be able to pin down what\'s most important to them. </p> <p>  Well before you start talking to your customers, you will need to prepare yourself mentally.  Get rid of any prejudices and preconceptions that could prevent you from taking on board any customer\'s point of view.  Take time, too, to develop a list of questions you want to ask.

Their answers will provide invaluable clues as to how you can service them better and encourage them to buy more from you. </p> <p>  Most of us are pretty clear about the value we would like to deliver.  However, we often fail to understand that same value from the perspective of our clients and customers.  Remember, they make assumptions based on their own interpretations.  That\'s why, before you can create meaningful value, you need to commit to listening to them.  </p> <p>  In any event, there can be no doubt that customers really value a business that asks for their feedback and shows willingness to solve their problems.

Hi! Good morning! Selamat pagi! Chao san!  </p> <p>  Whichever way you say it, how you greet another person says not just a good deal about your relationship, or potential future relationship, but also something about yourself. </p> <p>  Experts say it takes just seven seconds to make a first impression on another person. That\'s just seven seconds for you to leave your mark. Just seven seconds for the person to decide who you might be. Just seven seconds to make a positive, or negative, impression. So how do you do it? </p> <p>  Even if you are a relaxed sort of person, unconventional, \'creative\'Ã‚Â, and not really into the \'corporate\'Ã‚Â thing, you have to remember that this is not about you. It never was and you will be on your best behaviour. You will dress appropriately and look like you mean business; and that includes your greeting. </p> <p>  When greeting, smile slightly as you speak. This will give your voice a positive inflection, lifting it at the edges. You raise your head. No shy furtive glances from under your eyebrows as this gives an impression of poor confidence and an inability to engage with others.  As you greet, look at them in the eyes and if that\'s too intimidating for you, one good tip is to look at the space just between their eyes, in the centre of the forehead. The person looking back will not know the difference.  </p> <p>  As you smile your \'good morning\'Ã‚Â positively, you may find yourself nodding slightly as you speak in this way and this gives the signal for others to smile back, albeit briefly. A firm handshake, friendly and polite, is what follows.  </p> <p>  Your first seven seconds, hopefully, will present someone confident, someone here to do some business but who is quite pleasant and not too pushy. </p> <p>  Of course, depending on the situation, who you are meeting and your own personality, you may want to go in rather serious and earnest, and ensure a good firm handshake from all your potential investors.

Fortunately for you, this means that by using social media outlets correctly, you can easily position yourself ahead of your competition and achieve greater success online. In order to get the most out of social media marketing, you must avoid these five critical mistakes: </p> <p>  <strong>1) Using social media pages solely to promote your products.</strong> </p> <p>  Of course, product promotion is an essential element of social media marketing; however, people don\'t want to see constant pitches on their timelines and Twitter feeds. </p> <p>  Instead of constantly bombarding followers with product pitches, dedicate some of your posts to providing valuable information. You can link to \'how-to\'Ã‚Â blog posts and website articles or post information about your company. Providing information helps enrich followers\' lives, which can make your social media content more interesting that keeps readers paying attention. </p> <p>  <strong>2) Failing to interact with followers.</strong> </p> <p>  Social media is not a one-way street. People follow your Facebook and Twitter because they want to connect with you and your company. Interacting with followers by responding to comments brings a personal element to your social media marketing efforts. You might be surprised by the willingness of followers to provide information that can help you build a stronger business. Remember the adage, \"People buy from businesses they know, trust, and likeÃ‚Â.\" </p> <p>  <strong>3) Posting irrelevant content.</strong> </p> <p>  Although you should post content that is not solely designed to promote products, make sure all of your social media content is relevant to your business. Avoid posting family pictures, reviews of books you\'ve read (unless they relate to your business), or stories about your dog. Irrelevant posts make you look unfocused and prevent potential customers from taking your business seriously.  </p> <p>  <strong>4) Ignoring cross-promotion.</strong> </p> <p>  Very few entrepreneurs succeed without working with other business owners. By using social media to connect with other entrepreneurs, you can reach a broader audience and potentially increase sales. Of course, you don\'t want to promote products offered by a direct competitor; however, you can work with complementary businesses to develop a cross-promotional strategy. Cross-promotion not only benefits you; it also benefits your followers. </p> <p>  <strong>5) Not using social media at all.</strong> </p> <p>  The worst mistake you can make is ignoring social media entirely. Five years ago, it was not unusual for entrepreneurs to achieve success without social media. Today though, potential customers expect the opportunity to learn more about businesses through Twitter, Facebook and other social media outlets. Even if you think you don\'t have the time to dedicate to social media marketing, it is essential that you establish a strong presence on these sites.  </p> <p>  Although social media can be time-consuming, the advantages you can gain from a solid social media strategy can be well worth the extra time and effort. Steering clear of these top five mistakes dramatically increases your chances of realising enviable business success on the Internet.   </p> <p></p>'),(2020,131,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/sharing-scaring.jpg'),(2021,131,220,'Sharing is Scaring'),(2022,131,221,'false'),(2023,131,224,'entrepreneurship'),(2024,131,225,'blue'),(2033,132,191,'Don\'t Be a Couch Potato, Invent a Potato Couch!'),(2034,132,193,'Don\'t Be a Couch Potato, Invent a Potato Couch!'),(2035,132,197,'<p>Written by Steven B.</p> <hr> <p> Let\'s face it; many people will not be successful in business, because they\'re not willing to take the required action.

This article will examine three ways to stop being a couch potato and start taking action. </p> <p>  <strong>Discover Your Talents</strong> </p> <p>  What activities do you enjoy, and that put a smile on your face? Now, it\'s time to do some brainstorming and discover how you can use these activities to start a business. If you like working with a group, you could tutor, be a public speaker, or a consultant in social marketing. If you\'re more on the shy side, you may be happier with solo activities, such as content writing or web design. </p> <p>  <strong>Hire a Mentor</strong> </p> <p>  When you\'re new to the business world, it helps to seek the counsel of someone who knows what you\'re going through.  This is where hiring a mentor comes in.

You\'ll also develop better organisational skills such as time management. </p> <p>  <strong>Classes/Training</strong> </p> <p>  Take advantage of any classes that are offered in your chosen field.

Known as the founding father of online cash processing service, PayPal, Elon Musk gained attention in the tech space for his creation of an intuitive, safe, and reliable service. Almost anyone who has made a transaction online has either used or heard of PayPal and understood its widespread and powerful name which has become synonymous with safe, online buying and selling.   </p> <p>  During his time as a child, he learned computer programming. Following his high school years, he moved to the United States and attended the prestigious Wharton School of Business at The University of Pennsylvania. It was from here that he graduated with degrees in Economics and Physics. Elon Musk then moved to Stanford to pursue a PhD in physics, but opted to drop out of the programme to pursue his great Internet idea, X.com.  </p> <p>  X.com eventually merged with a similar sized company who operated a service known as PayPal. With the merger complete, Musk decided to operate under the latter\'s name and, from there on, became the person who would revolutionise how people exchange goods and services online.  </p> <p>  Today, Musk focuses strongly on his space company, SpaceX and his electric car company, Tesla Motors. SpaceX is a private, commercial space exploration and tourism company which is still in its pre-consumer stages. It has successfully launched a spacecraft into outer space and even had one successfully dock at the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX has announced plans to transport astronauts to the ISS and eventually to encourage normal human space exploration and settlement on Mars. Musk shows here that his drive is not solely for profit, but for the prospects of changing the trajectory of humankind. Probably the more famous current endeavor of Musk is Tesla Motors. Operating as a luxury electric-powered automobile company, Tesla hopes to revolutionise the energy and automobile industries. Today, Tesla Motors is not only changing the perceptions towards electric cars, it is also the only profitable electric car company in the world.  </p> <p>  Musk\'s latest entrepreneurial, technological idea is the Hyperloop, a much-touted \'fifth major mode of transport\' which allows users to travel up to 1,287 kilometres per hour. This would mean that a 640-kilometre trip between Los Angeles and San Francisco would take 30 minutes by Hyperloop. Musk has stated on record that he has no plans to do anything with Hyperloop for now since both SpaceX and Tesla Motors takes up most of his time, but is considering the project to be an open-source transportation concept, subject to feedback from anyone with interest. </p> <p>  Although the Hyperloop idea may not be embraced readily, Elon Musk has proven, time and time again, that he is a great inventor, marketer, and innovator. These qualities have given birth to a system which makes spending money online easier, a company which may one day expand the horizons of man, and a business that has, and will, continue to revolutionise the way people live. Musk should be considered, without opposition, one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our time.    </p> <p></p>'),(2052,133,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/elonmusk.jpg'),(2053,133,220,'All about the hole'),(2054,133,221,'false'),(2055,133,224,'entrepreneurship'),(2056,133,225,'blue'),(2057,134,191,'What do great entrepreneurs have in common?'),(2058,134,193,'What do great entrepreneurs have in common?'),(2059,134,197,'<p>Written by Renee P.</p> <hr> <p> Besides being moguls in their respective industries, Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg are all considered to be representative examples of what true, great entrepreneurs are. They all possess a certain, intricate set of skills and characteristics which make them the cream of the crop in their fields and which cause envy among rivals and admiration among followers. Overall, these greats all have four major things in common which set them apart. </p> <p>  <strong>Proclivity to Take Risks</strong> </p> <p> 	 Easily the most prevalent thing that is noted in great entrepreneurs is their tendency to take risks. The first step in being a great one is having the courage, fortitude, and confidence to take risks. All of the above mentioned icons believe strongly in the products they present and the abilities they have. These, coupled together, allow them to make tough decisions with little apprehension and gain much success in doing so. Not only do they opt to take these risks, they also take the proper steps to cover their backs.  </p> <p>  <strong>Ability to Inspire</strong> </p> <p>  Another thing all of the great moguls in the world have in common is their ability to inspire their audiences, consumers, and employees. Steve Jobs was well noted for his breathtaking presentations on some of the most popular products on the market. Other great CEOs and company leaders continue to achieve success due to the loyalty their employees and consumers exhibit toward them.  </p> <p>  <strong>Capacity to Lead</strong> </p> <p>  The capability to lead several, dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of people is something that is rare and difficult to master. Commanding respect from each and everyone in the organisational structure of a company, from executive to maintenance, is a talent that is only possessed by the very best entrepreneurs. One must be assertive without being confrontational in order to best display this characteristic. He or she must be willing to compromise without always giving into opposition. Leadership is tough and is something that comes with time.  </p> <p>  <strong>Diligence</strong> </p> <p>  The final and most important trait found among all of the entrepreneurs mentioned is their diligence. With diligence comes everything virtuous in human beings. Patience, kindness, and justness are all born from being diligent. The ability to set a goal and see to it that it is met is an attitude that is few and far between in society. Striving for excellence is a necessity for anyone who wishes to be an entrepreneur.  </p> <p>  Being an entrepreneur requires hard work, integrity, leadership skills, and decisiveness. Although there are a plethora of habits and features that distinguish the prime entrepreneurs in society from one another, all of them have these four that are staples of what it takes to be a magnate in any industry and are of the utmost importance in entering the business world.    </p> <p></p>'),(2060,134,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/great-entrepreneurs.jpg'),(2061,134,220,'Great Entrepreneurs'),(2062,134,221,'false'),(2063,134,224,'entrepreneurship'),(2064,134,225,'red'),(2065,135,191,'Faster Fail!'),(2066,135,193,'Faster Fail!'),(2067,135,197,'<p>Written by Donald T.</p> <hr> <p> Many would-be entrepreneurs never get out of the starting gate for fear of failure. What many don\'t realise is that failure is a useful tool. Seasoned entrepreneurs utilise past failure to ensure the success of future ventures. They will tell you that failure is a reason to keep trying, not to give up. Here are four reasons why you should keep trying no matter how many times you fail.  </p> <p>  <strong>Failure Conquers Start-up Fear</strong> </p> <p>  The biggest initial hurdle to starting a business is doing just that. The prospect is so overwhelming and frightening that many would-be entrepreneurs don\'t even begin. Ask yourself what the worst consequence would be if your business idea fails. If launching a business is secondary to your main source of income and won\'t significantly drain your resources, go for it. Approach your first start-up as just that: your first start-up. You will be less likely to get bogged down in fear of failure.  </p> <p>  <strong>Failure Teaches Invaluable Lessons</strong> </p> <p>  Even if your start-up fails, the lessons you will learn along the way will be priceless. They will also contribute to your success down the line, perhaps in a totally different type of venture. If you view failure as a teacher, not as a negative result, you will have a much higher chance of success in your next venture. Seasoned entrepreneurs know this. Every failure is a chance to learn priceless lessons on what works and what doesn\'t for the next time. But there can\'t be success if you never get out of the gate.  </p> <p>  <strong>Failure Develops Confidence</strong> </p> <p>  This sounds counterintuitive, but when you fail at one thing, the experience will toughen you up and give you confidence to pursue the next venture, regardless of the possibility that it might not succeed. It is kind of like being fired. The prospect seems devastating to someone who has never experienced it. But go through it once and you will realise getting fired did not kill you, the world did not end and there are countless opportunities on the horizon to excel at. Successful entrepreneurs know that when one door closes, another door opens. </p> <p>  <strong>Failure Develops an Entrepreneurial Mindset</strong> </p> <p>  Those with true entrepreneurial spirits will tell you that they have to keep trying, no matter what. It is an obsession. If these entrepreneurs start businesses that do not succeed, they try and try again, as fast as possible. They don\'t sit around and mope about the failed business venture. Time is money. They hurry up and fail until they succeed. This is the mindset of a true entrepreneur. Don\'t let the possibility of failure be a negative factor along your entrepreneurial path. Failure should be seen in a positive light. So, go ahead! Faster fail!  </p> <p></p>'),(2068,135,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/faster-fail.jpg'),(2069,135,220,'Faster Fail'),(2070,135,221,'false'),(2071,135,224,'entrepreneurship'),(2072,135,225,'blue'),(2073,136,191,'You Shouldn\'t Be an Entrepreneur Lah!'),(2074,136,193,'You Shouldn\'t Be an Entrepreneur Lah!'),(2075,136,197,'<p>Written by C.K. Goh</p> <hr> <p> There are dozens of reasons why you might want to strike out on your own and begin your journey as an entrepreneur. Unfortunately, most of these reasons do not make you a good candidate for entrepreneurship and could increase your risk of burnout and cause you to end up hating your business. </p> <p>  The Three Worst Reasons for Becoming An Entrepreneur </p> <p>  <strong>1) Potential for greater income</strong> </p> <p>  Nearly everyone who aspires to entrepreneurship dreams of making millions of dollars a year. After all, Donald Trump, Sir Richard Branson, and Bill Gates did it. Unfortunately, monetary success is the exception, not the rule. It is important to remember that about 90 percent of all new businesses fail within the first five years. It is, of course, possible to achieve financial success through entrepreneurial endeavors; however, the odds are stacked against you. </p> <p>  <strong>2) Increased freedom</strong> </p> <p>  It\'s common for aspiring entrepreneurs to think that they can run successful businesses and still have plenty of time for social obligations, vacations, and everyday tasks. For many entrepreneurs though, freedom is elusive, at least during the first few years. You can expect to work twice as hard as you would if you continued to work for someone else. The majority of new entrepreneurs devote nearly every waking hour to their businesses, often for meager financial rewards. Some even routinely sacrifice sleep just to keep their businesses afloat.  </p> <p>  <strong>3) Power and prestige</strong> </p> <p>  The idea of being the CEO of your own company might sound alluring. You might think that being the boss gives you the prestige and power to dictate your own life and run your business the way you want. Although being on top looks good on paper, you will likely have to answer to more people than you ever dreamed possible. Employees, lenders, clients, and vendors all run your life.  </p> <p>  <strong>So Why Should You Become an Entrepreneur?</strong> </p> <p>  Without wealth, freedom, and power, why would you ever want to become an entrepreneur? There is one reason that can make the long hours and constant demands of your company\'s formative years worthwhile: the satisfaction of bringing a product or service that doesn\'t yet exist to your customers.  </p> <p>  If you want to succeed as an entrepreneur, you must have a vision that will change your community, your industry, or the world. Think Steve Jobs. The excitement of bringing an entirely new product or service to market, or providing a better version of an existing product, can sustain you even when the process of building a business takes its toll on your sanity.  </p> <p>  So before you quit your job to become an entrepreneur, take the time to identify your personal vision. Once you have made that vision concrete, determine if you believe in it strongly enough to weather the lean years, stress, and setbacks that commonly come with entrepreneurship.   </p> <p></p>'),(2076,136,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/man-with-suitcase.jpg'),(2077,136,220,'Man With Suitcase'),(2078,136,221,'false'),(2079,136,224,'entrepreneurship'),(2080,136,225,'red'),(2081,137,191,'Startup \'Bored\' Meetings'),(2082,137,193,'Startup \'Bored\' Meetings'),(2083,137,197,'<p>Written by Stefie L.</p> <hr> <p> Startup boards often try to imitate the board meetings that large multinationals have. They look at cash flow statements, income statements and waterfall charts. To a startup that\'s barely in its second year of operations there are just two things that matter - cash balance and burn rate. To focus on anything but this turns out to be a waste of time for a startup. </p> <p>  Startups don\'t have thorough business models. Board meetings are where ideas for new business models are discussed. What hypotheses do the board members bring in? How well does one go about validating or discrediting each? It can be a wasted board meeting that doesn\'t discuss these matters. </p> <p>  <strong>There are other basic mistakes made aping the board meetings at large corporations:</strong>  </p> <p>  Analyzing the past does have its place; a startup board meeting isn\'t such a place, though. Many startup CEOs will decide to use their board meetings to pick apart mistakes made in the past. Not only is management discussion and analysis a debilitating process, with a small company, it can take up time that\'s meant to help the company move forward. It is usually a good idea to keep the analysis part at any startup board meeting to a minimum. Dwelling on past mistakes isn\'t the only way to drown in analysis. It\'s possible to go too deep into the specifics of any part of a board meeting discussion and waste time. Board meetings are supposed to be higher-level discussions about general policy. High level meetings that get into micromanaging problems are rarely productive. Startup board meetings run off course for reasons of regular carelessness too. </p> <p>  <strong>Not working in extra time for the formalities:</strong> </p> <p>  Startups have board meetings for the simple reason that they are a part of their funding contract. Time does needs to be set aside for board resolutions and other legal requirements. Short board meetings aren\'t likely to get much done when there are legal requirements that take up all the time. </p> <p>  <strong>Not following a plan:</strong> </p> <p>  It can waste a lot of time when everyone attending isn\'t aware of the plan you have for it. Many board meetings waste considerable time by allowing members to take the meeting in unplanned directions. In the end, there is often no time left for the matters that are actually included in the agenda. </p> <p>  <strong>Not making sure that everyone remembers what the board meeting was about:</strong> </p> <p>  It doesn\'t matter how much productive work was done at a board meeting, if no one remembers the key takeaways once the meeting winds up, it is all wasted. It\'s always a good idea for the chairman to prepare a short and descriptive circular of the key takeaways of every meeting to send out to all attendees afterwards.    </p> <p></p>'),(2084,137,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/bored-meetings.jpg'),(2085,137,220,'Bored Meetings'),(2086,137,221,'true'),(2087,137,224,'leadership-and-management'),(2088,137,225,'blue'),(2089,138,191,'Can you work for free?'),(2090,138,193,'Can you work for free?'),(2091,138,197,'<p>Written by Kathy B.</p> <hr> <p> Lucky you! Your business needs to hire an employee. Instead of celebrating, you\'re wondering how to pay someone to work for you. Count yourself lucky again, because you\'ve just found an article that can solve your problem. These two methods show you how to get good help when you can\'t afford to pay wages.  </p> <p>  Can you induce volunteers to help out? Three consecutive weekends each fall, up to eighty volunteers head to Holy-Field Winery in Basehor, Kansas, to pick grapes. Volunteer turnout has grown so much that owners Les and Michelle Meyers now require reservations. Michelle Meyers told a local reporter that the two of them would be unable to complete the harvest and would have trouble paying a crew, but volunteers keep the winery operating.  </p> <p>  Why do people volunteer? One attendee reported that he brings his children every year because it is a fun activity with educational benefits. \"It builds family memories\",Ã‚Â he said.  After plucking fruit, guests can watch the winemaking process and enjoy a banquet lunch. Helpers also take home a t-shirt, which not only makes them feel appreciated, it promotes Holy-Field\'s branding.  </p> <p>  If you need low-skilled work that requires minimal training, consider whether volunteerism could meet your needs. If so, you\'ll need to identify what benefits you can offer the people in exchange, determine who would be interested in that opportunity, and then reach out to them with your request. </p> <p>  Secondly, try incentives. Incentives can motivate people to devote their time to your success. If you sell high-dollar products or services, subscriptions of any type, or establish customer accounts, commission-based pay lets you keep your existing budget by surrendering a percentage of future income. Your sales team\'s earnings are based entirely on their performance, so it\'s a low-risk method to generate sales. </p> <p>  Structuring the tasks you need to be completed in a way that lets you use one of these two methods will expand your business opportunities. If the type of help you need isn\'t conducive to these methods, consider alternatives. You may believe you should hit the streets to make sales and hire an office assistant. Since this is a semi-skilled position that isn\'t stringent enough to require college-level education, but would be hard to fill with a volunteer, you could opt to take care of the office yourself and use a commissioned salesperson to do the sales. They may not perform as well as you could, but you won\'t perform well if you\'re doing double duty, either.  </p> <p>  As your business continues to grow, you\'ll have the means to pay them fairly. Until then, use these techniques to keep your lucky star rising.   </p> <p></p>'),(2092,138,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/balloons.jpg'),(2093,138,220,'Balloons'),(2094,138,221,'false'),(2095,138,224,'leadership-and-management'),(2096,138,225,'red'),(2097,139,191,'Is your business Shaolin enough?'),(2098,139,193,'Is your business Shaolin enough?'),(2099,139,197,'<p>Written by Eurica P.</p> <hr> <p> Whether you practice karate or some other martial art practice, the techniques used are the same for running a successful business. Both martial arts and business must achieve goals. For the martial artist, it\'s the black belt. For the entrepreneur, it\'s profits and company growth.  </p> <p>  <strong>Mastery of the Craft</strong> </p> <p>  The martial art devotee must be open to instruction from his teacher. Constant practice refines his skill. The entrepreneur is unlikely to know everything about starting or running a business but also requires guidance and instruction that can come through socializing with those who know the industry and can help him refine skills. Help is readily available from upline sponsors and management, yet few new affiliates ever contact those who can best help them succeed.  </p> <p>  <strong>Flexibility</strong> </p> <p>  Any martial art practice demands flexibility of body movements. Constant practice teaches the student to synchronise the body and mind to produce results. It\'s no less true in the business world. Every business must adapt quickly if it is to survive in a competitive market. You need to meet and overcome obstacles by staying flexible and open to change.   </p> <p>  <strong>Continuous Learning</strong> </p> <p>  Even a master of a black belt never stops learning. Every business needs to evolve through learning and practice. He attends seminars and workshops. He implements new ideas and concepts that help increase the profitability of his business. Just like the martial art practitioner, he fails from time to time, but he continues to advance by learning from his failures.  </p> <p>  <strong>Mental Discipline</strong> </p> <p>  Physical disciple alone seldom earns a black belt. The key to success is mental discipline. Both businessman and the martial artist pay attention to what must be accomplished today. That requires mental skills to organise, plan and communicate. Success is limited when there are no achievable goals. </p> <p>  <strong>Appreciation</strong> </p> <p>  The martial art student always bows to his teacher. It\'s more than a sign of respect. It\'s an acknowledgment. Too many businesses today pay more attention to the bottom line and forget that their master - the customers. Appreciation means more than putting out quality products. It means being attentive to the customer\'s needs before, during and after the sale.   </p> <p>  <strong>Pushing the Limit of Endurance</strong> </p> <p>  The martial art student is often prodded to stretch his limits, well beyond what the student thinks he\'s capable of. The more the limits are tested, the more proficient the student becomes. It\'s easy for a business manager to coast through positive economic climates. The real test comes when things get bad and hard decisions must be made. Endurance is improved by taking action even if that action proves to be a failure.   </p> <p></p>'),(2100,139,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/shaolin.jpg'),(2101,139,220,'Shaolin'),(2102,139,221,'true'),(2103,139,224,'leadership-and-management'),(2104,139,225,'blue'),(2105,140,191,'Black in Business: Managing Perceptions'),(2106,140,193,'Black in Business: Managing Perceptions'),(2107,140,197,'<p>Written by Eurica P.</p> <hr> <p> Picture the scene. You are walking with a friend along the side of a lake and you see a small boy in the water.  His hands are in the air and his mouth is wide open as he shouts.  You are convinced that he is screaming for help.  Your companion believes that he is shouting for joy. </p> <p>  Everyone has their own individual perception of a situation or another person.  This perception is created by what you see, hear, smell, feel, taste, think and understand.  It is the process of using your senses to gather information about the surrounding environment, including people.  Scientifically, perception is explained as being as the neurological processes involved in acquiring and mentally interpreting information from the senses. </p> <p>  Very simply, a perception is an attitude or understanding based on what is observed or thought.  It involves insight, a subjective view, acuity and sharp awareness.  Perception is your \'take\' or assessment of a situation. When you constantly notice or discern things that seem to escape other people, you become known as being \'perceptive\'Ã‚Â. We all know the common saying that \'perception is reality\'.  Whether this is true or not, it is a fact that the way people perceive your business, its brands, products and service directly influences their inclination to do business with you. </p> <p>  In order to successfully run a business of any size, you need to manage the perceptions of a diverse group of people. Of prime importance are your consumers. Your customers are just as important; corporate buyers, wholesalers and retailers who can make or break your business. </p> <p>  The perceptions and purchase decisions of these two groups are heavily swayed by influencers such as architects, engineers, accountants, attorneys, business advisors, consultants, family members and friends. </p> <p>  The perceptions of your agents, distributors and dealers are also extremely important to your business, as are those of your suppliers and your own employees. Of course, the media have the power to exert great influence over your potential consumers and customers too. </p> <p>  So make a point of getting to understand the perceptions of all the stakeholders in your business. Find out how your customers, suppliers, employees and others view your business by carrying out perception research. Even if you are not in a position to carry out independent formal research, you can still unearth plenty of useful information by asking people a few questions yourself.

You might have stood in front of it before. Many business owners have, and most of the time it\'s innocent enough. After all, you know what your company is capable of, and you\'d hate to lose out on a client over the perception that you\'re too small, too new, too inexperienced, and the like. But attempting to make your business seem larger than it really is could backfire, and in general, is a dangerous game to play. </p> <p>  First of all, the most obvious problem is that you\'re misleading your client. Whether it\'s as simple as putting some pictures of your friends on your website to simulate a staff or handing out fake titles to be used like spy covers at meetings to artificially add depth to your management team, in the end, you\'re lying to your client, and that has the potential for all kinds of negative outcomes. </p> <p>  Secondly, you\'re creating an illusion in the mind of your client that might come back to bite you in the butt. The reality is, business owners are generally intelligent and they know their business. A lot of them also started out small just like you. They\'re not going to automatically stonewall you just because you\'re small. But, if the size of your firm is a problem for them, then it\'s a very real possibility that the scope of the work they need may very well be outside of your capabilities. </p> <p>  By leading them to believe that you\'re bigger than you are, you might find yourself in a situation where you\'re in over your head, trying to tackle a project or wrangle a client that you just aren\'t capable of handling. The client won\'t understand why, and you\'ll have the unfortunate problem of having to either figure out a way to deal with your giant headache, or explain to the client that you can\'t actually produce what you claimed. That kind of hit to your reputation could be severely detrimental. </p> <p>  So next time you have a meeting with a potential client, and you\'re tempted to fib a little as to what your staff size or capabilities are, don\'t do it. Leave the fun house mirror at home. Instead, let your experience and the qualities of your work speak for itself. Sure, it\'s possible you may not land the deal, but at least you won\'t have to worry about all of the possible negative side-effects of lying to clients, and you can move on to the next proposal knowing full well you\'ll be able to deliver on exactly what you promise.   </p> <p></p>'),(2116,141,219,'/sites/ABS/img/box_images/fun-fair-mirror.jpg'),(2117,141,220,'Fun Fair Mirror'),(2118,141,221,'false'),(2119,141,224,'leadership-and-management'),(2120,141,225,'blue'),(2121,141,251,''),(2130,98,251,''),(2148,140,251,''),(2157,138,251,''),(2175,132,251,''),(2184,129,251,''),(2193,136,251,''),(2202,128,251,''),(2211,130,251,''),(2220,134,251,''),(2229,133,251,''),(2247,124,251,''),(2274,125,251,''),(2355,127,251,''),(2364,126,251,''),(2373,139,251,''),(2382,137,251,''),(2391,131,251,''),(2400,135,251,''),(2401,142,137,'Facing Changes in Documentary Credit (Klang Valley) '),(2402,142,138,'September 2013'),(2403,142,139,''),(2404,142,140,''),(2405,142,141,'Trade & Finance'),(2406,142,228,'  <h1>FACING CHANGES IN DOCUMENTARY CREDIT </h1>  <p>Area: Trade and Finance</p>  <p>Objectives: Letters of Credit (LC) can be an effective payment mechanism, provided you get the details right.

The whole house is filled with family members fussing about how long it’s been since they’ve all seen each other and piling their plates high with the spread Aunt Marie put out.</p><p>You put your phone down for all of two seconds to fill your plate. That’s all your 5-year-old cousin Carla needs. She grabs your phone, squeals, and runs straight for the bathroom.&nbsp;<em>Flush</em>. Not only is your phone in the toilet, it’s now trapped in the U-bend. With God knows what else...</p><h3>Dropped it at a concert</h3><p>It’s the last big outdoor concert of the summer, and you and your friends are in the front row taking it all in. Who cares if the field is muddy beyond reason from all the rain last week? This is your favorite rapper (probably the single most important emcee to come out in years), and it’s your last chance to see him perform before the seasons change. That alone makes the rain-boots-in-August thing worth it.</p><p>It’s the last song in the set, and you pull out your phone to capture the third encore going on onstage. After all, if it’s not on Instagram, it didn’t happen. The bass booms, the crowd roars,, and someone behind you leaps up with the chorus, knocking your phone right out of your hands and into the mud. Your life flashes before your eyes as you watch it slowly sink into the muck, never to Instagram again.</p><h3>Robbed on the subway</h3><p>You’re on your way home after a late night at the office, and you’re dead on your feet. You’ve got a splitting headache, and your legs feel like jelly. “This lifestyle is unsustainable,” you think. “Why couldn’t I just live off a trust fund and vacation in Costa Rica every year?” you think. Thoughts like this swirl around in your head as you sit down in that subway car and swiftly pass out.</p><p>You quickly snap to in what feels like a moment later. You missed your stop maybe about an hour ago, and you’re in a part of town you don’t recognize. You reach into your pocket to check your phone and pull up a map app...only it’s gone! You frantically search the train car, and even nudge the friendly hobo at the end of the car, asking if he saw anything. Nothing. Your phone is lost. And so are you.</p><h3>Outdated in a day</h3><p>Or how about this? You’re relatively comfortable with your phone right now, but you’re due for an upgrade. You’ve already weathered the two years before you’re eligible for a new one, and you’ve waited patiently to find the bleeding-edge device you think will suit you just right. The timing is perfect, and you feel good about your next purchase.</p><p>When you finally buy that new smartphone, you glory in its features. It’s light, sleek, and powerful. What could be better? Well, a better phone. Which came out the day after your bought yours. Angry tears well up in your eyes as you curse heaven and the 729 days of smartphone envy you have ahead. It\'s not a good look.</p><p>Any one of these scenarios could happen to you. A few of them might have already. The point is, it’s time for something different.

So why\r\n haven\'t the 15 Colorado counties affected by the floods made the \r\nchanges that could have stopped the water from ripping apart these \r\ncities and claiming eight lives?</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Image: http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/190n9ldqtbcj5jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg\" src=\"http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/190n9ldqtbcj5jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg\" alt=\"Why We Dont Design Our Cities to Withstand 1000-Year Floods\" height=\"471\" width=\"640\"></p><p><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-smaller\">As\r\n early as 1923, the Olmstead Brothers (the sons of Central Park designer\r\n Frederick Law Olmstead) recommended keeping a large area of open space \r\naround Boulder Creek, via <a href=\"http://weadartists.org/colorado-marking-floods\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Women Environmental Artists Directory</a></span></em></p>\r\n<p>\"Nothing \r\nthat you can build is ever going to prevent all flooding,\" says Dr. \r\nJosephine Axt, the chief of planning for the Los Angeles District of the\r\n U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manages levees, dams and other \r\nurban river projects across the country. \"If you get a big enough storm \r\nit doesn\'t matter what dam or channel you have, it can be overcome.\" The\r\n Corps of Engineers works is doing so by evaluating its projects on a \r\ncost-risk basis, says Kerry Casey, a senior hydraulic engineer. \"We\'re \r\ntrying to find the best project we can build that absorbs the risk \r\nrequirement at the best cost.\"</p><br>'),(2917,161,264,'/_collections/1/ku_xlarge.jpg'),(2918,161,265,'nature'),(2919,161,270,'true'),(2920,56,271,'FAST.
